# Arrays Console App

## Overview

This assignment is a deliverable for [Code:You](https://code-you.org/)'s Software Development with C# pathway. In this assignment we were to create simple program that should:

- Initializes and populates an array with a series of values. It can be an array of anything - just make sure it has more than 2 or 3 values.
- Uses a `foreach` loop to iterate over those values and display them to the console.

**Note**: I used this as an opportunity to experiment and get my hands dirty. Included an `Entity` class to be the data type that the loop stores and iterates over. Still need to read up on what constructors an object should have and class properties

## To Run Locally

| Tools                       |
| --------------------------- |
| .NET SDK                    |
| VS Code                     |
| C# Dev Kit VSCode Extension |

#### Instructions

1. Verify that you have the .NET SDK installed. To do this, run `dotnet --version` in GitBash. If a version number is not returned, you can [download the .NET SDK here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).
2. Once you have verified that the .NET SDK is installed, open GitBash and `cd` into the directory of your choice.
3. Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/dan-collins-dev/Arrays-Console-App.git` in GitBash
4. `cd` into the cloned project and open it with VS Code
5. In VS Code's integrated terminal, run `dotnet build` followed by `dotnet run` to build and run the application.
